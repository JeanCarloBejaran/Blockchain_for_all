# Blockchain_for_all
Blockchain projects that tokenize the resolvement of real world problems.

Idea:

Marketplace of chains solving a real world problem. 

Technically:

Leverage the tokenization of real-world assets to solve problems.

Example: Red Rocks RTD line for Denver.
Tons of people go to Red Rocks. If RTD would be open to build a line from Denver to red rocks but needed money, as an alternative to taking on citizen debt, could they raise funds by partly privatizing the funding in exchange for future proceeds / profits / voting rights on changes?

Example: Healthcare data accessibility smart contract.
Executes at a certain time. Ex: If this gene is found in one of my descendents then give access to my medical history to that person. We might not want our loved ones to have access to our health records while we are alive but have sort of a self-executable will at the time of an event. 


Summary:
Blockchains "Materialize" energy in the digital world. Energy is harnessed through code in the present moment through network processing to cement a block in time. 

Business Model Concept: 
Bring real world assets into the digital world and solve problems by processing information and giving instructions.
